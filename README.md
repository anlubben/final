This is my final project for BIOL 4324: Bioinformatics.

The aim of this project is to identify any differential expression of the FKBP5 gene in post-mortem hippocampal (specifically dentate gyrus) tissue in bipolar individuals compared to controls.

FKBP5 is a co-chaperone protein involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity. FKBP5 binds to Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), a chaperone protein that maintains the proper folding/functioning of GR receptors. By binding to HSP90, FKBP5 reduces the protein's sensitivity to glucocorticoids (like cortisol).

Upregulation of the FKBP5 gene is associated with high exposure to chronic stress. At the same time, high levels of stress serve as a major predictor/risk factor for bipolar disorder. Therefore, I hypothesize that there will be higher expression of the FKBP5 gene in the bipolar patients, likely as a response to elevated cortisol levels in the bloodstream.
