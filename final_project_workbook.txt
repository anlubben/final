Final Project Workbook


10/8
* Study designed, as per project planning document
* Research question identified: Is differential expression of the FKBP5 (FKBP prolyl isomerase 5) gene correlated with diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder?


10/10
* Identified relevant study with accessible dataset (Kohen, R., Dobra, A., Tracy, J. H., & Haugen, E. (2014). Transcriptome profiling of human hippocampus dentate gyrus granule cells in mental illness. Translational psychiatry, 4(3), e366. https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2014.9)
* Identified dataset on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE42546
* Uploaded fastq files (Bipolar: SRR620448.fastq.gz, SRR620450.fastq.gz, SRR620452.fastq.gz, SRR620449.fastq.gz, SRR620451.fastq.gz, SRR620453.fastq.gz; Controls: SRR620464.fastq.gz, SRR620465.fastq.gz, SRR620466.fastq.gz, SRR620467.fastq.gz,  SRR620468.fastq.gz, SRR620469.fastq.gz) to the cluster at ~/final/
* Uploaded cleaned, raw counts file (GSE42546_CleanedRawCounts.txt.gz) to the cluster ~/final/analysis
* Validated dataset


10/16
* DESeq2 downloaded from https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html
* DESeq2 added to ~/final/analysis


10/22
* New git branch "final" initialized at ~/final
* SSH key added to GitHub; local directory connected to GitHub repository 
* Contents of ~/final/analysis staged and pushed to GitHub 


10/25
* Created R script
   * Obtained Bioconductor DESeq2 package from https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html
   * Obtained tidyr and dplyr via tidyverse package from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/readme/README.html
   * Obtained pheatmap package from https://rdrr.io/cran/pheatmap/


10/29
* Continued R script
   * DESeq2, tidyr, dplyr, and pheatmap are loaded
   * Gene table loaded
      * "filtered" variable is created from cleaned, raw counts file (GSE42546_CleanedRawCounts.txt.gz) 
      * "filtered_subset" variable created; samples are restricted to 16 Bipolar patients (B1- B16) and 16 control patients (C1-C16)
   * Metadata table created (samples x group)
      * "x" lists sample IDs for each group (16 bipolar and 16 control).
      * "y" creates a corresponding list of group labels ("bipolar" and "control"), repeated as needed.
      * "df" data frame is constructed to represent samples and their respective condition
   * "group_vector" added as a factor for DESeq2 analysis
   * Created "dataset_object", data frame of filtered sample names (colnames from "filtered_subset") and group ("group_vector")
   * Minimally expressed genes (genes with a sum less than 10 across samples) filtered from data
   * DESeq2 object "dds" created using DESeqDataSetFromMatrix, with countData from "num_filtered" and colData from "dataset_object".
      * "design=~group" specifies that analysis should consider the group factor to detect differential expression between bipolar and control groups
   * run "dds" object and normalize counts
   * Results
      * resultNames(dds) lists coefficients (i.e. differences between groups)
      * "res" lists results from "group_control_vs_bipolar" contrast
      * "res4" extracts log fold changes, p value, p adjusted, etc.
      * "res_shrink" object created using lfcShrink to stabilize variance estimates on log fold changes
   * Data frame of shrunk results with statistics saved in .csv file ("DESeq2_results_shrunk.csv")


11/4
* Created and wrote README.md
* Prepare heatmap
   * "gene_ids" created using row names of "normalized_counts"
   * Created dataframe with average counts for each condition
   * "high_var_genes" identifies genes with variance greater than 0.5 "heat_map_scaled" created as a data frame using only "high_var_genes"
* Heat map created as a .png file (heatmap.png)
   * clustered both genes and groups
* Ran into an unidentified issue (output file displaying as 2 x 2 grid?)
* Uploaded R script file to GitHub repo
* Pulled GitHub repo to cluster


11/11
* Troubleshooted heatmap script
   * scaled into "average_counts_s"
   * removed high_var_genes
   * removed "gene_ids"
* Uploaded R script file to GitHub repo
* Pulled GitHub repo to cluster


11/19
* Re-organized files in cluster and in GitHub
   * Created "output" directory, containing heatmap and DESeq2 results file. Pushed to GitHub.
   * Renamed "bipolar" and "controls" directories in cluser to "bipolar_data" and "control_data" respectively to reflect that these contain the raw FASTQ files.
